# Make Repository Public for GitHub Pages

Your repository is currently **private**, but GitHub Pages (free tier) requires it to be **public**.

## Quick Steps to Make Repository Public

### Via GitHub Web Interface:

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - https://github.com/Shubh-go/Shot-Sync/settings

2. **Scroll down to "Danger Zone"** (at the bottom)

3. **Click "Change visibility"**

4. **Select "Make public"**

5. **Type the repository name to confirm:** `Shubh-go/Shot-Sync`

6. **Click "I understand, change repository visibility"**

## After Making It Public:

1. **Go back to Pages settings:**
   - https://github.com/Shubh-go/Shot-Sync/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Source: `main` branch
   - Folder: `/web`

3. **Click Save**

4. **Your site will be live at:**
   ```
   https://shubh-go.github.io/Shot-Sync/
   ```

## Alternative: Keep Private with GitHub Enterprise

If you need to keep it private, you can upgrade to GitHub Enterprise (paid), but for a public-facing website, making it public is the standard approach.

## Note

- Making the repository public means the code is visible to everyone
- This is standard for web projects and portfolios
- Your web files are already meant to be public (they're client-side code)
- The iOS app code being public is also fine - many open-source projects do this
