5. Follow the prompts to set it up:
   - You'll need your phone number
   - Google will send you a verification code
   - Enter the code to verify

### Step 3: After 2-Step Verification is ON
1. Go back to the Security page: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll down to **"How you sign in to Google"** section
3. Now you should see **"App passwords"** listed below "2-Step Verification"
4. Click on **"App passwords"**

### Step 4: Generate App Password
